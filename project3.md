## Project description

This project is a game where you have to navigate through a maze of obstacles and enemies. You are greeted with a menu where you have various options (Fig 1) and then instructions are displayed to help you navigate the game (Fig 2). When you play (Fig 3) you simply use WASD to move around as shown in the gif. There is also a map management section where you can design your own maps (Fig 4). The program works by parsing text files and using it as map data, so the user can edit it themselves and design their own.

## How to compile and run the program

```
// simply open the project in Net Beans, then run it in the IDE.
// you should be able to play in the terminal
```

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.

## 3. Additional Considerations
You need to make sure you have Java installed and you are running the program in Netbeans. Project presentation is on the homepage.
