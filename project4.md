## Project description

Compresses any file type using Huffman tree compression algorithm. We see the test data (Fig 1) before the program is run and how it is nearly 30,000 lines of data! After running our make command, the program outputs the frequency of each character/byte (Fig 2) and then all character mappings (Fig 3). This was mainly used for debugging but is now a way for the user to understand exactly what happens. We then how much was saved and finally the compressed files end in .huff (Fig 4).

## UI Design

There is no UI design since it is a terminal program. The user does not need to do much either since all the program does is encode and decode files. The make commands is all the user needs to use in order to interact with this program.
